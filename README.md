# Ultrasonic Sensor TrafficLight System 

 A simple project for managing a one-way road traffic signal system with pedestrian crossing and a buzzer.

## KeyPoints:
- #### Yellow: A blinking yellow light indicates that pedestrians can safely cross the road.
- #### Green: Pedestrians should not cross the road under any circumstances if the light is green with a beeping buzzer.
- #### Red: Red light indicates that traffic should stop until it turns green.
